## 🚀 Overview

GSMS is a production-style backend system that simulates a real government service platform.

Key features:
- Secure authentication and authorization (JWT)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Multi-database architecture (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- Clean layered architecture
- Fully Dockerized infrastructure
- CI/CD automation
- Unit-tested business logic

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates real-world backend engineering practices, including:

- Secure authentication and authorization
- Fine-grained role-based access control
- Proper use of relational and NoSQL databases
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dockerized deployment
- CI/CD automation
- Testable and maintainable codebase

## 🧱 Architecture

```text
Client (Web / Mobile)
        ↓
Spring Boot REST API (Java 21)
        ↓
+----------------------------------+
| MySQL     | Users & Auth (ACID)  |
| MongoDB   | Services & Requests  |
| Redis     | Cache (Performance)  |
+----------------------------------+
```

## 🗄️ Database Strategy

```text

| Database | Usage                         | Reason                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MySQL    | Users, Authentication, Roles  | ACID consistency                   |
| MongoDB  | Services and Service Requests | Flexible schema                    |
| Redis    | Caching                       | High performance & reduced DB load |
```

## 🔐 Security

        Implemented security mechanisms:
        
        JWT-based authentication (stateless)
        
        Spring Security 7
        
        BCrypt password hashing
        
        Method-level and URL-based authorization
        
        Custom UserDetailsService
        
        Secrets managed via environment variables

No credentials or secrets are stored in source code.
```text
| Role        | Permissions                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| SUPER_ADMIN | Full system control                 |
| ADMIN       | Manage users and services           |
| OFFICER     | Review and process service requests |
| CITIZEN     | Submit and track service requests   |
```
